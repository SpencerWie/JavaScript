<p>In that past we normally used cookies as storage on the clients machine, although cookies were small and not too secure. With HTML 5 becoming the standard there is a new way to store client-side information known as <b>Web Storage</b> or <b>DOM Storage</b>, there are two JavaScript objects that support HTML5 storage:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>localStorage</b> - Stores the information cliently on a database, information is not lost when the browser is closed.</li>
<li><b>sessionStorage</b> - Store the information temporarily in a page session, but the information is lost when the page is closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently we can store up to 5 Megabytes of information, much more than what cookies could store. HTML5 storage is also more secure that cookie storage.</p>
<p>Here is how to create a <em>variable</em> that uses localStorage:</p>
<pre>localStorage.myVariable = ... ;</pre>
<p>Here is how to create a <em>variable</em> that uses sessionStorage:</p>
<pre>sessionStorage.myVariable = ... ;</pre>
<p>And here is how you can check if a particular localStorage or sessionStorage variable exist or not:</p>
<pre>
if(localStorage.myVariable){
   // It exist, change it.
} else {
   // It doesn't exist, make it.
}
</pre>
<p>Now for a simple example I will store button clicks in both session and local storage:</p>
<button id="localStore" class="btn btn-success">Local Clicks : 0</button><br /><br />
<button id="sessionStore" class="btn btn-success">Session Clicks : 0</button><br /><br />
<p>And here is the code below:</p>
<pre>
function localStore(){
   if(localStorage.clicks){
      localStorage.clicks++;
   } else {
      localStorage.clicks = 1;
   }
   document.getElementById("localStore").innerHTML = "Local Clicks : " + localStorage.clicks;
}

function sessionStore(){
   if(sessionStorage.clicks){
      sessionStorage.clicks++;
   } else {
      sessionStorage.clicks = 1;
   }
   document.getElementById("sessionStore").innerHTML = "Session Clicks : " + sessionStorage.clicks;
}

document.getElementById("localStore").onclick = function(){ localStore(); }
document.getElementById("sessionStore").onclick = function(){ sessionStore(); }
</pre>
