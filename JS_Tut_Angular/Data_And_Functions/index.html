<h1>Data and Functions</h1>
<p>Data types and functions are essentials of programing. Functions allow us to separate out our logic and code to make our life simpler, that way we can narrow our focus and solve hard problems in baby steps. Data to the computer is simply a bunch of 0's and 1's, but we can use it to represent things such as: Numbers ,Text, Lists, etc. In this section we will take a look at Functions, Data Types, and Variables.</p>
