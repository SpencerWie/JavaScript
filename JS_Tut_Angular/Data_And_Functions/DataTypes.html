<p><strong>Data Types</strong> are simply different ways we represent our Data. While there are a lot of different data types, we will just talk about the basics. In JavaScript data types are <strong>dynamic</strong>. Which means that the same variable can be used as a different type. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Numbers</b> - ( Integers [5] and decimals [1.205] )</li>
<li><b>Strings</b> - ( Text ["Hello World"] )</li>
<li><b>Arrays</b> - ( A list of items [1,2,3,4,5] )</li>
<li><b>Booleans</b> - ( True or False statements )</li>
<li><b>Objects</b> - ( Something that has properties[adjectives] and methods[actions] )</li>
<li><em>null, NaN</em> - (Something undefined, something that is not a number)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Variables</strong> are simply a way to store our data. In JavaScript they are represented by the keyword "var". Here is the syntax:</p>
<pre> var myVariable = Value; </pre>
<p>Here are some examples of variables being declared.</p>
<pre>
&lt;script&gt;  
   var x = 5; // x is a Number
   var y = "Hello World"; // y is a String
   var z = true; // z is a Boolean
   var i = [1,2,3,4,5]; // i is a Array of Numbers
   var j = ["Spencer","Calvin","Alex","Max","Jason"]; // j is a Array of Strings
   x = "Im a String" // x is now a String
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<div class="alert alert-info">We will take more about objects in the future on a sections all about objects.</div>
