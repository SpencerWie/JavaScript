         <p>Comments are very useful in programing. They are basically ways to make notes in your code to understand what you are doing. It's a good idea to write comments about how you will do something before you write it out in code. There are two types of comments in JavaScript, single-line comments and multi-line comments:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script&gt;  

   //This is a single line comment, this single line is ignored.

   /*
   This is a Multi-line comment.
   All these lines are between the comment are ignored. 
   They are between the asterisks. 
   */
   
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
