      
  <p>It's good to know where to run your JavaScript while going through your HTML file. Problems can occur if JavaScript is not placed properly, such as trying to change an element that does not exist yet. For example:</p>
<div><em>&nbsp;myExternalScript.js</em></div>
<pre>document.getElementById("myElement").innerHTML = "Hello World";</pre>
<pre>
...
<font color="#FF0000">&lt;script src="myExternalScript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</font>
&ltp id="myElement"&gt;Test&lt/p&gt;
...
</pre>
      <div class="alert alert-danger">Note: We are running the JavaScript before we made the element. So the element we are trying to change does not exist yet.</div>
      <p>The basic solution to this problem is placing your JavaScript file at the very end of your &lt;body&gt; tag:</p>
<pre>
&ltbody&gt;
...
&ltp id="myElement"&gt;Test&lt/p&gt;
...
&lt;script src="myExternalScript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt/body&gt;
</pre>  
      <p>And this will properly change the element's text into "Hello World". Another way is to use: <strong>window.onload</strong></p>
<div><em>&nbsp;myExternalScript.js</em></div>
<pre>
window.onload=function(){
   document.getElementById("myElement").innerHTML = "Hello World";
}
</pre>
         <p>Now we can place our JavaScript file anywhere we want and it will still wait for the page to be done. Although it is commonly placed inside the &lthead&gt tag.</p>
         <div class="alert alert-info">Note: If that first line looks like a bunch of gibberish to you that's fine. Just know that it means we are running that code when the page is done loading. And the code that runs is within these brackets { ... }. Once we get into learning functions many of these things will make much more sense.</div>
         <div class="alert alert-info">Adv Info: window.onload will fire when the entire page loads (images and external files). Another way is document.onload, which fires when the DOM is finished (Images and external files may still be loading though). Generally window.onload is often safer to use, although is a bit slower than document.onload. window.onload is known as the standard for most modern web browsers.</div>
