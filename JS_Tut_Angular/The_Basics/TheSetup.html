                 <p>First thing is setting up our JavaScript environment, so we can run javascript. To add JavaScript in HTML we simply use the &lt;script&gt tag, and place JavaScript code inside of it:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script&gt;  
   My JavaScript Code  
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
                 <p>This is known as <strong>internal JavaScript</strong>, which is JavaScript within your HTML file. But it's better practice to separate your HTML from your JavaScript (Just like separating CSS from HTML). Below is an example of <strong>external JavaScript</strong>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script src="myExternalScript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     
</pre>
                 <p>And in our "myExternalScript.js" we would have just our JavaScript. It would be the same thing as the first example but without the &lt;script&gt; tags:</p>
                 <div><em>&nbsp;myExternalScript.js</em></div>
<pre>
My JavaScript Code    
</pre>
                 <br/>
                 <div class="alert alert-info">Note: "myExternalScript.js" needs to be in the same directory as your HTML file in this example.</div>
