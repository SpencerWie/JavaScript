<h1>Object Oriented Programing</h1>
<p>Object Oriented Programing (known as OOP for short) is a model of programing by using objects as events in our program other than independent step-by-step actions (known as <em>Procedural Programming</em>). OOP makes your code much more organized and easier to understand, and is also very useful for group projects. In this section I will explain Objects in more detail and show you how to make your own Objects.</p>
