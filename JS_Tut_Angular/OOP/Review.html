<p>We went over a bunch or large topics. Here are some important  points we went over:</p>
<p>Objects</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Class</b> : Contain their own functions(methods) and variables(properties) [Like a Cookie Recipe]</li>
    <li><b>Objects</b> : Are an instance that is created from a class [Like a cookie]</li>
    <li><b>Constructor</b> : Is the method called when an instance is created</li>
    <li><b>this</b> : Property for this particular instance</li>
</ul>
<p>Inheritance</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Inheritance</b> : Is a relationship between two classes, such that the child inherits methods and properties from a more abstract parent class.</li>
    <li><strong>Child</strong> : A sub-class that was created based on a main-class.</li>
    <li><strong>Parent</strong> : A main-class that all sub-classes were based on.</li>
    <li><b>Parent.call(this, ...)</b> is placed in the Constructor of the child to inherit from some Parent. </li>
</ul>
