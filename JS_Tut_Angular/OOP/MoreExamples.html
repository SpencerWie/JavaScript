<p>If the last example was a bit too complex here is a simpler example:</p>
<pre>
function Person( name ) // Creates a class called "Person"
   {
   // It's ok to use ( this.name = name ) JavaScript can tell the difference.
   this.name = name; // Makes a property called: name. 
   
   this.sayHi = function() // alerts it's name
      {
         alert("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
      } 
   }

var person1 = new Person("Spencer");
var person2 = new Person("Calvin");

alert( person1.name ); // => "Spencer"
person1.sayHi(); // => "Hello, my name is Spencer"
person2.sayHi(); // => "Hello, my name is Calvin"
</pre>
<p><button class="btn btn-success" onclick="objEx_1()">Run</button> </p>
<hr>
<p>There is more than one way to create a class in JavaScript, the current why I have been showing you is the simplest in my opinion. Another way to create objects which is slightly more efficient is using: <b>prototype</b>. Which is a property to add methods to objects. For example here is the same Person class setup using prototype with a side-by-side comparison:</p>
<div style="width:50%; float:left">
<p><em>Prototype</em></p>
<pre>
function Person( name ){
   this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.sayHi = function(){
   alert("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
}
</pre>
      </div>
         <div style="width:50%; float:left">
         <p><em>Without Prototype</em></p>
<pre>
function Person( name ){
   this.name = name;
   
   this.sayHi = function(){
      alert("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
   }
}
</pre>
</div>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<div class="alert alert-info">The difference between using prototype and non-prototype is how methods are created. When you are not using prototype all methods are re-created for each instance, while prototype keeps a single method to use making it a bit more efficient. One way isn't particularly better than the other, for now I recommend choosing which is comfortable for you.</div>
