         <p>Another branch structure that has very similar functionality as the <em>if-else if-else</em> stucture is the <b>Switch-Case</b> structure. Here is an outline and it will be explained below:</p>
  <pre>
switch( variable ) 
{
case 1:
  // Execute block if (variable === 1)
  break;
case 2:
  // Execute block if (variable === 2)
  break;
default:
  // Execute code if all cases fail 
}
</pre>
      <p>Switch-Case uses a variable to compare to and checks the strict equality of that variable to each case. In this case if the variable is 1 then the first block will execute. The <em>default</em> is like the <em>else</em> in the if-type structures, such that if all cases are false then default will run. <b>break</b> is to exit some block of code early. It is used in this case so it does not run into other cases (since code is naturally sequential) .</p>
      <p>For a better understanding lets put a <em>if-else if-else</em> structure next to a <em>switch-case</em> that do the same thing:</p>
      <div style="width:50%; float:left">
<pre>
switch( x ) 
{
case "one":
  alert("x is one");
  break;
case "two":
  alert("x is two");
  break;
default:
  alert("x is not one or two.");
}
 
</pre>
      </div>
      <div style="width:50%; float:left">
<pre>
if(x === "one")
   {
   alert("x is one");
   } 
else if(x === "two")
   {
   alert("x is two");
   }
else
   {
   alert("x is not one or two");
   }
</pre>
      </div>
