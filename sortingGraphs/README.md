These are some basic sorting algorthims implemented in HTML5 Canvas as visual sorts. The challenge is using timer methods properly to get the desirsed wait between loops (such as nested ones), this proved to be a bit tricky to do. Currently two basic sorting algorthims are supported: 

<ul>
<li>Bubble Sort</li>
<li>Selection Sort</li>
<li>Insertion Sort</li>
</ul>

Bug fixes: Fixed null localStorage variables with defaults.
