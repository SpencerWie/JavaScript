**GraphEdit** is a program that allows you to easily create and save graphs. The user will be able to save their graph as an image (PDF, JPG, GIF, etc) or as a *.json* file, in which can be used to save the graph and load and modify it later. The user will be able to create nodes and edges via an interface, left-click will be to create a node/link. And right click will bring up a properties dialog (on the side) to change the node/connection.
