basic_box.js : A basic template-like program to make sure everything is working. The 3D box is rendered in openGL abstractly adding different face colors. you can spin the box with the arrow keys.

mouseBox.js : An extension of basic_box.js but includes rotation by using the mouse. Note that rotation is on the global axies while threejs only supports convenient methods for local rotation. I may fork threejs and add my own function to do this.
