         <h1>Object Oriented Programing</h1>
         <p>Object Oriented Programing (known as OOP for short) is a model of programing by using objects as events in our program other than independent step-by-step actions (known as <em>Procedural Programming</em>). OOP makes your code much more organized and easier to understand, and is also very useful for group projects. In this section I will explain Objects in more detail and show you how to make your own Objects.</p>

        <h3>Classes</h3>
      </a>
    </div>
    <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-body collapse in">
     <div class="accordion-inner">
         <p><strong>Classes</strong> are their own structure that contain their own functions (known as <b>methods</b>), and their own variables (known as <b>properties</b>). <strong>Objects</strong> are things created from a class. For example you can look at a class as a <b>(recipe, blueprint, template)</b>, and an object something created with the (recipe, blueprint, template). Like cookies for example, you have a cookie recipe (class) and the cookies (objects). And you could make a variety of cookies from the same recipe: big or small, peanut butter or chocolate chip.</p>
         <p>When you create something from a class it's known as an <strong>instance</strong> (a particular object of the class). Every instance is independent of other instances, changing one will not change others. Here is how to create an object/instance:</p>
         <pre>var obj = new Object(...); // obj is an instance of the Object class.</pre>
         <p>Calling a method from an Object: </p>
         <pre>obj.methodName(...);</pre>
         <p>Getting a property of an Object: </p>
         <pre>obj.propertyName;</pre>
         <p>For example lets look at the our Human Race as a Class, then each human would be an instance of the Human class. Some properties we would have would be: height, gender, and hair color. And some methods might be: run, breath, jump, and dance.</p>
         <p>In fact <em>Numbers, Strings, Arrays, etc, are all Objects</em>. And they can be defined as an instance. For example lets look at a instance of the String class and it's methods and properties (shown in Data & Functions section):</p>
<pre>
var myString = new String("Hello world"); // Create a string as an object.
myString.toUpperCase(); // Method to change the string to uppercase. => "HELLO WORLD"
myString.indexOf('W'); // Method to get a index in the string. => 6
myString.length; // returns the length Property of the string. => 11
</pre>
         <p>The method that is called when an object is created is called a <strong>Constructor</strong>. Often the constructor sets the default values of the properties of instance. In this case the String Constructor [ String(<em>string</em>) ] takes a single argument and sets it's string property to the given argument.</p>
         <div class="alert alert-info">In a classical sense JavaScript does not have classes. Although this is because JavaScript is based on prototyping and not class-based, we can easily create behavior the same as a class and treat it as so. In which I will consider a class in JavaScript for simplicity.</div>

        <h3>Creating Objects</h3>
      </a>
    </div>
    <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-body collapse">
      <div class="accordion-inner">
         <p>The best way to understand objects, classes, instances, and so on is to create them yourself. We can create our very own Objects, here is an outline:</p>
<pre>
function ClassName( arg* ) // Creates a class called "ClassName"
   {
   //This is the Constructor
   this.property1 = .. ;
   this.property2 = .. ;
   //End Constructor
   
   this.method1 = function( arg* ) // Makes a method called "method1"
      {
      // Code for method1
      }
 
   this.method2 = function( arg* )
      {
      // Code for method2
      }   
   }

var myObj = new Class( ... ); // Creates an instance from our Class.
</pre>
      <p><strong>this</strong> means <em>for this particular instance</em>. So when we say: <em>this.variable</em> , it means the variable belonging to the current instance. Don't get confused that it says: <em>function ClassName(...)</em>, read it as: <em>class ClassName(...)</em>. The <em>class</em> keyword is not yet implemented in JavaScript so the <em>function</em> keyword is used.</p>
      <p> Lets look at some examples, here is a Ball Class:</p>
<pre>
function Ball( X, Y, R, Color ) // Creates a class called "Ball"
   {
   this.x = X; // Makes a property called: x.
   this.y = Y; // Makes a property called: y.
   this.r = R; // Makes a property called: r ( radius )
   this.color = Color; // Makes a property called: color.
   
   this.moveTo = function(newX, newY) // Makes a method called: moveTo(newX, newY).
      {
         this.x = newX; // Change the x to the new position
         this.y = newY; // Change the y to the new position
      } 
   }

var redBall = new Ball(40,40,25,"Red"); // Creates a red ball from Ball class.
var blueBall = new Ball(200,40,35,"Blue"); // Creates a blue ball from Ball class.
</pre>
      <canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="80" style="border:1px solid #555555; display: block; margin: auto"></canvas><br />
      <div class="smallCode">redBall.moveTo(60,45);</div><button class="btn btn-success small" onclick="redBall.moveTo(60,45);">Run</button> <button class="btn btn-info small" onclick="redBall.moveTo(40,40);">Reset</button> <br /> <br />
      <div class="smallCode">blueBall.moveTo(150,40);</div><button class="btn btn-success small" onclick="blueBall.moveTo(150,40);">Run</button> <button class="btn btn-info small" onclick="blueBall.moveTo(200,40);">Reset</button> 
      <br /><br />
      <div class="alert alert-info"> <b>arg*</b> means 0 or more arguments. In set thoery the Kleene Star ( <b>*</b> ) means zero or more. This is so we can represent a variety of things from <em>Object()</em> to <em>Object(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)</em>. </div>

    </div>
    <div id="collapseFour" class="accordion-body collapse">
      <div class="accordion-inner">
         <p>If the last example was a bit too complex here is a simpler example:</p>
<pre>
function Person( name ) // Creates a class called "Person"
   {
   // It's ok to use ( this.name = name ) JavaScript can tell the difference.
   this.name = name; // Makes a property called: name. 
   
   this.sayHi = function() // alerts it's name
      {
         alert("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
      } 
   }

var person1 = new Person("Spencer");
var person2 = new Person("Calvin");

alert( person1.name ); // => "Spencer"
person1.sayHi(); // => "Hello, my name is Spencer"
person2.sayHi(); // => "Hello, my name is Calvin"
</pre>
         <p><button class="btn btn-success" onclick="objEx_1()">Run</button> </p>
         <hr>
         <p>There is more than one way to create a class in JavaScript, the current why I have been showing you is the simplest in my opinion. Another way to create objects which is slightly more efficient is using: <b>prototype</b>. Which is a property to add methods to objects. For example here is the same Person class setup using prototype with a side-by-side comparison:</p>
         <div style="width:50%; float:left">
         <p><em>Prototype</em></p>
<pre>
function Person( name ){
   this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.sayHi = function(){
   alert("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
}
</pre>
      </div>
         <div style="width:50%; float:left">
         <p><em>Without Prototype</em></p>
<pre>
function Person( name ){
   this.name = name;
   
   this.sayHi = function(){
      alert("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
   }
}
</pre>
         </div>
         <p> &nbsp; </p>
         <div class="alert alert-info">The difference between using prototype and non-prototype is how methods are created. When you are not using prototype all methods are re-created for each instance, while prototype keeps a single method to use making it a bit more efficient. One way isn't particularly better than the other, for now I recommend choosing which is comfortable for you.</div>

    </div>
    <div id="collapseFive" class="accordion-body collapse">
      <div class="accordion-inner">
         <p>Sometimes we want to make a class that inherits the methods and properties of another more abstract class, known as <strong>Inheritance</strong>. For example lets say we have a class called <em>Animal</em>, and we want to make another class called <em>Bird</em> with the same methods and properties, but have a few extra such as fly(). We could also have <em>Mammal</em> and <em>Reptile</em> also be based on <em>Animal</em>. We could set this up in a tree structure known as an: <strong>inheritance tree</strong>.</p>
         <img src="inheritance_tree.png" alt="Inheritance Tree" style="display:block ;margin:auto"></img>
         <ul>
         <li><strong>Child</strong> : A sub-class that was created based on a main-class.</li>
         <li><strong>Parent</strong> : A main-class that all sub-classes were based on.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Here is an example is a Parent and a Child class implemented in JavaScript:</p>
<pre>
function Parent( arg* ){
   this.P_prop = arg*;
       
   this.P_func = function(){
        // Code for parent method.
      }
   }

function Child( arg* ){ // The same arguments as the 'Parent' class.
    <b>Parent.call(this, arg*);</b> // This creates 'Child' to be based on 'Parent'.
    
    this.C_func = function(){
        // Code for child method.
    }
}
</pre>
      <p>And here is a implementation on the Parent class Animal, and child class Bird:</p>
<pre>
function Animal( name ){
   this.name = name;
       
   this.getName = function(){
        alert("It's name is "+this.name);
      }
   }

function Bird( name ){ 
    <b>Animal.call(this, name);</b> 
    
    this.fly = function(){
        alert(this.name+" flew up in the sky.");
    }
}
</pre>
      <p>So the Animal Class as a property: name; and a method: getName(). While the Bird class inherited the property: name and method: getName(), special to it's class it has another method fly().</p>
<pre>
var animal = new Animal("Fred");
var bird = new Bird("Jack");

// Both Animal and Bird have getName.
animal.getName(); // => Fred
bird.getName(); // =>  Jack
//animal.fly(); <-- Animal does not have a fly method
bird.fly(); // => "Jack flew up in the sky."
</pre>

            <li><b>Constructor</b> : Is the method called when an instance is created</li>
            <li><b>this</b> : Property for this particular instance</li>
            </ul>
         <p>Inheritance</p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Inheritance</b> : Is a relationship between two classes, such that the child inherits methods and properties from a more abstract parent class.</li>
            <li><strong>Child</strong> : A sub-class that was created based on a main-class.</li>
            <li><strong>Parent</strong> : A main-class that all sub-classes were based on.</li>
            <li><b>Parent.call(this, ...)</b> is placed in the Constructor of the child to inherit from some Parent. </li>
