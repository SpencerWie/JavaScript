         <h1>The Preface : Programing</h1>
         <p>Hello, my name is Spencer Wieczorek and I'm a Computer Science student at IUPUI. In this tutorial I will give you an introduction to programing, in this case we will be using JavaScript. I chose this language because it is easy to understand and very easy to setup and share with other people, all you need is a web browser. Here are some requirements/information about this tutorial:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Level: Beginner</li>
            <li><em>Requirement</em>: Knowledge of HTML and CSS.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The information in this tutorial is compacted, I may go into specific detail on somethings in this tutorial. If you are completely new to programing you may have to go back re-read things quite a few times. It's good to utilize other resources to get better/more information on things, here are a few good resources you can use:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a> - This is a great place to starting playing with JavaScript right away. It has a nice interface to! Here is an setup example: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/hAEfS/">JSFiddle Example</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codeademy</a> - A nice place to learn many programing languages, they have interactive tutorials. You can join groups and make your own tutorials as well. </li>
            <li><a href="w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> - Although not directly affiliated with W3, they still offer great web development resources that are basic and easy to learn.</li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript">Mozilla</a> - Mozilla has more accurate and detailed tutorials on many web-related topics.</li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Programing</strong> is a tools for creativity and problem solving; it is the manifestations of your thoughts into elegant systems. You can do <em>anything</em> with it, and you can apply anything into programing: I personally like making games. Computer Science is the study and creation of procedural systems that solves a task (<em>algorithm</em>): as in we are interested in the <em>process of the task</em> that leads to the solution, not the solution itself. While programing is the implementation and execution of these procedures, and is currently the greatest tools a computer scientist can use to implement. Becuases of this programing and computer science are related, but not the same. </p>
