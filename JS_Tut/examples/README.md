Pong : http://jsfiddle.net/nDtLK/6/

A basic pong game with two paddles, the lower paddle is the player which is controled with the mouse while the computer follows the ball based on where it is. The computer's max speed determinds it difficulty (which can be changed easily), the code itself was created so things can be changed easily. The ball can be tilted more or less based on the movement of the paddle, if the paddle was moving quickly left while it hit a ball going left, this would cause the ball to move left even faster. It also has a basic menu screen with a start button.
