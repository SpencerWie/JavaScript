This is a project that was done for a Computer Science Data Structures and Algorthim class. In which we implement a normal k-means and a probabilistic k-means. The normal k-means converts the image into a 2 colors (RED and GREEN) while probabilistic will convert to grey-scale to compute faster. The Probablilic kmeans runs a grey-scale k-means 25 times and is more effiecent than the normal k-means in color. This is in Java Script so here are the programs below:

Probabilistic k-means: http://cs.iupui.edu/~spdwiecz/JavaScript/k-means/kMeans_prob.html

Note: For probalitic the graph is for every possible color. The very left is (0,0,0) and the vey right is (255,255,255), how black these points are means how often they were in the culster. Pure Black means 100% while pure white means 0%.
